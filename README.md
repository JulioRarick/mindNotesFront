<h1>mindNotes</h1>
The mindNotes is a web application that I developed to enhance my skills in JavaScript, both on the back-end, using Node.js and Express, and on the front-end, using React. It was designed to provide an intuitive and efficient experience in organizing study notes and important information. With a user-friendly interface, users can create, view, and delete their notes quickly and easily. Furthermore, MindNotes offers advanced features, such as the ability to add useful links directly to the notes, facilitating access to external resources related to the content of the notes. Tags allow effective categorization of notes, enabling users to organize them according to themes, subjects, or any desired criteria.


With integrated search features, finding specific notes is quick and easy, even in large volumes of information.
MindNotes was developed with a focus on simplicity, performance, and usability, providing a powerful tool for students, professionals, and enthusiasts who want to keep their information organized and accessible anytime, anywhere. Additionally, it is a project that is constantly evolving to incorporate new features and enhancements to the application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
